# Chess-Game-Winner-Prediction


## Introduction


The objective of this project is to use the <b>database</b> from an online chess game (<a href="https://lichess.org/"> Lichess </a>), containing information about players and their rankings, to <b>predict a winner</b> between two players through <b>machine learning</b> technics, based on the players profile data.

## How it works

The dataset (<b>games.csv</b>) was taken from the website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess">Kaggle</a>, and was the input to train the two learning models implemented: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">K-Nearest Neighbors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest"> Random Forest </a>. <b>Hyper-parameterization</b> was also used to improve the result, testing different parameters for the models functions.
